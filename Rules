Work In Progress: 2nd Rough Draft**







[**Introduction**]()

** **

Through rose tinted glasses,
our scene is set on the streets of the Greater Seattle area where roving gangs
of bicycle riding raccoons battle over territory to secure a consistent supply
of the 3 most important things to _Procyon
lotor_ when found in their "natural" urban habitat; sustenance,
shelter, and high-end fixed-gear bike parts.



You play as one of these
now-retired chain breaking raccoons, retelling stories of the old glory days to
your grandkits around the trash-fire. There are many reasons why you might have
entered the lucrative and dangerous bike component game. But whether you grew
up in the streets as a parts peddler or this was only a temporary decrease in
your stature, you were in a bad situation at the time and you really needed the
cash.



One things for sure, the
Chain Gangs didn’t look kindly on the thieves and
vagrants they found trespassing in their territory. So you were either already
an established member in one of these gangs, “protected” by them in exchange
for a hefty weekly quota of trash/bike parts, or simply new in town and just
lucky enough to stay off the radar.

[**How
to Play Raccoontuers & Racketeers**]()



The following sections will
cover making your raccoons, establishing character relationships, and
everything else the game-master needs to know in order to run the game.



[]()**1.
Raccoon Generation**

** **

**1.1. Ability Scores**

Roll 6d6 and assign one die to
each ability:



●
**Literacy
- ****_“Ability to Read/Write”_**

Read/write human, “Book Smarts”, etc.

●
**Mimicry
- ****_“Ability to Imitate”_**

Speak Human,
Ventriloquism, etc.

●
**Jugglery
- ****_“Manipulation/Trickery”_**

Carrying Off Schemes,
Ruses, Lies, Disguises, “Street
Smarts”, etc.

●
**Celerity
- ****_“Rapidity of Motion”_**

Running, Climbing,
Swimming, Jumping, Sleight of Hand, etc.

●
**Ferocity
- ****_“Propensity of Harm”_**

Scratch, Bite, Maim,
intimidate, etc.

●
**Rotundity
- ****_“Level of Roundness”_**

Remain steadfast in
adversity thanks to your generous roundness.



If you have 3 (or more) 1’s,
then you may re-roll all 6D6 at once until you have less than 3. If you roll
all 6’s, then you also get to manually choose your 2 starting items.



**1.2. Starting Items **

You get 2 items
at the beginning of the game, this number is simply due to the fact that you
only have 2 hands. Unless you find a creative way to carry more items, you can
only carry 2 items for the rest of the game and will need to set them down to
do other actions.



To select your
starting items you must roll a 1D20

twice on the list below:



**1.  BASEBALL
BAT W/ NAILS:** This one seems pretty darn
self-explanatory.

**2.  CASSETTE
TAPE:** A-Side is Queen’s Greatest Hits
supposedly.

**3.  FAKE ID:** Use this to buy booze & weed despite the fact you’re likely 2-3 years
old, and a raccoon.

**4.  BROOM:** The ultimate anti-raccoon weapon, also works against cars,
people, and dogs.

**5.  BROWN
CARDBOARD BOX:** Multipurpose logistics and obfuscation
device.

**6.  SMART
PHONE:** Call your friends, take pictures,
browse the web!

**7.  COUGH
SYRUP:** Doesn’t work on coughs, but at least it’s a mild
narcotic.

**8.  GRAPPLING
HOOK:** Perform sweet grapple tricks.

**9.  BALLOON:** The kind you can use to float around… Until it pops!

**10. DOG MASK:** Pass yourself
off as a dog, they’ll
never suspect a thing!

**11. FAKE BEARD AND GLASSES:** Conceal your identity… Just ignore the tail.

**12. LUBE:** A solution to
things sticking.

**13. ANIMAL CONTROL KEYRING:** Either dropped or stolen, these are the keys to raccoon
Super-Max.

**14. LIT CIGAR:** How’s it staying lit? It’s
seriously been that way for weeks...

**15. POLICE SIREN:** Makes
noise and lights. Clears traffic temporarily.

**16. LEAD PIPE:** Helps
you hit stuff harder. +1 against kneecaps & Romans.

**17. TURBO ROCKET:** One
use per race (up to 3/day), +3 to speed. It’s not rocket science.

**18. DUCT TAPE:** A
solution to things not sticking.

**19. BANANA:** Delicious!
Also, other things might slip on the peel...

**20. HANDGUN:** A loaded
Ruger LCP II chambered in .380 ACP that hold 6+1 rounds.

** **

**1.3. Background**

Why did you, a raccoon,
enter the dangerous and lucrative world of bike theft? Are you a wide-eyed
rookie or a grizzled veteran? Was it for the money, the thrill, or do you just
not know anything else? Are you part of a Chain Gang? Are you an undercover cop?
Who are your rivals & are they human? Do they even know you exist? What’s
the conflict at the heart of you that spurs drama? **Write a short
origin story for your raccoon, and give them a name.**

** **

[]()**2.
Character Relationships**

** **

**2.1. Nemesis**

This individual is the crux
of your existence. You will likely do anything to see that they fail. This can
range from something like a sibling rivalry or something much more insidious.
Maybe they killed your best friend. Or maybe they’re
a former ally who betrayed you. Who ever they are, you think they really just
suck.



Roll 1D20, a result of 1
means the player 1D6 seats to your left is your nemesis and a result of 20
means the player 1D6 seats to your right is your nemesis. Any other result
means your nemesis is an NPC of your creation.



Other than telling the GK,
this is your secret to disclose as you like. Though if your nemesis is another
PR and they are aware of your existence, double check they are okay with doing
the things you blame them for having done. Other players personal agency is
more important than your backstory.



**2.2. Associate**

This individual is someone
you work with that either owes you a **Debt**
or vice versa. The two of you must work together as associates until the debt
is invoked or the owner of the debt no longer requires the assistance.



Roll 1D20, a result of 2
means the player 1D6 seats to your left is your associate and a result of 20
means the player 1D6 seats to your right is your associate. Any other result
means your associate is an NPR of your creation.



Then roll 1D6 to determine
who owes who. If the result is even, they owe you a favor. If it’s
odd, you owe them a favor._ [If your associate is
another PR, first inform them of this debt and then roll the 1D6 for who owes
who in a place both of you can see.]_

[]()**3.
Rules**

** **

**3.1. General Actions - ****“Ability Check”**

Roll a number of D6 equal to
the relevant ability when you attempt an action. If your action ties into your
origin story, add a D6 to your roll. If it ties into the central conflict in
your origin story, add another. Furthermore, you may add a D6 if you have an
item relevant to your action.



Each D6 with 4+ generates
one success, while each 1 generates one **Flub**.
Most simple tasks need only one success, but some difficult ones may require
many more. The GK must publicly announce this value once the tasks difficulty
is set. If you exceed the check by one success, you may narrate an additional
minor effect that occurred as you succeeded. For each success beyond this, you
gain one **Triumph**.



**3.1.1. Flub**

For each 1 on a D6 during a
check, you generate one Flub, a global currency representative of your raccoons
cumulative mistakes. If a raccoon has more than **three Flub**, other Raccoons may spend their **Triumph** to invoke negative **Defects**
on them.





**3.1.2. Defects **

**Defects** are negative traits that raccoons can invoke on others when a
targets **Flub** is equal to

3 or
higher. They have a

relevant ability and a

value of severity
equal

number of **Triumph** spent
on them (up to a maximum value set by the targets current **Flub**). This maximum is treated as a total of all defects currently
applied from the raccoon who invoked them. This means each other raccoon may
also invoke defects on the same target without interfering with one another.



Formatted as [(Relevant Ability)(Severity) - “Flavor
Text”]



The

severity is the

number
of dice they subtract before rolling ability checks of the relevant type.
You may give this whatever narrative flavor you like as long as it is temporary
in nature. (ex. [Celerity 2 - “Sprained Ankle”]
would cost 2 Triumph points, require the target to have a minimum Flub level of
3 in order to invoke, and result in them subtracting 2 dice from any celerity
checks until the defect is resolved).



**3.1.3. Triumph**

Triumph is a personal
currency representative of your Raccoons cumulative successes. You may use it
at any time.



One point of Triumph may
be redeemed to:

- Re-roll a D6 during a
check.

- Add an major effect to a
success.

- Add up to 2 minor
effects to a check, successful or not.

- Inspire another player:
+1d6 to their check.

- Distract another Player:
-1D6 to their check.

- Invoke a level of Defect
(up to the targets current Flub level).

- Remove a level Defect
from yourself (down to your current Flub level).

- Lower your Flub level by
one.



**3.2. Vehicles**

** **

**3.2.1. Vehicle Stats**

Vehicles require multiple
Raccoons to operate them and have 3 stats; Top Speed, Durability, Complexity.
Top Speed is the maximum number of speed dice. Durability is the amount of
damage it can withstand. Complexity is the Difficulty of repair.



There are 5 types of
vehicles:



**Pedal-Powered:**

- Tricycle - Requires 1
Raccoon - [Top Speed: 5][Durability: 5][Complexity: 1]

- Bicycle, Child -
Requires 2 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 10][Durability: 7][Complexity: 2]

- Bicycle, Adult -
Requires 4 Raccoons - [Top Speed: 15][Durability: 10][Complexity: 3]



**Motor-Powered:**

- Motorcycle - Requires 3
Raccoons - [Top Speed: 30][Durability: 15][Complexity: 4]

- Automobile - Requires 5
Raccoons - [Top Speed: 50][Durability: 20][Complexity: 5]

** **

**3.2.2. Operating the Vehicle**

Players choose an action by
secretly setting a D6 to a number of their choice, then revealing them all at
once. **NO CONFERRING!**



Actions are carried out in
order from lowest (1) to highest (6):

1: BRAKE: Speed -1 (-2 for
cars)

2: TURN LEFT: About 30°

3: TURN RIGHT: About 30°

4: USE ITEM: Do something
with an item

5: ACCELERATE: Speed +1
(+2 for cars)

6: ACTION! (Miscellaneous
actions)



The GK moves the vehicle in
accordance with the Raccoons’ collaborative
actions. The GK is the final arbiter of this; they also move the other vehicles
around to react to what’s going on.



SPEED starts at 0. At the
end of each round, the GK rolls D6 equal to speed. For each dice that shows 1,
the vehicle takes 1 damage. For each dice that shows 4+ you get a success.



Spend successes as a
group, with more successes achieving more difficult/impressive feats,

to:

- Streak ahead of rivals

- Run chumps off the road
(if you’ve made
contact with them)

- Do cool tricks, like
jumps and skids

- Find, or create, a
better route through the streets of Seattle

- Create an obstacle to
block path.



**3.2.3. Collisions & Damage**

If the vehicle makes contact
with an obstacle (or a wall) it takes damage if the GK feels it would be appropriate.
If it’s a glancing blow, or a breakable object, the car takes
damage equal to half speed. If it’s a head-on crash, or a solid object, it
takes damage equal to speed, and speed is reduced to 0.



If your vehicle takes damage
equal to (or higher) than it’s Durability, it
ceases to operate until you repair it or find some other means of moving it. If
it takes any further damage without repair, results may be catastrophic.



**3.3. Harm & Misfortune**

If a Raccoon fails a
dangerous action, they’re in trouble and must be
assisted/rescued by their friends (or begrudging associates). Player Raccoons
don’t take serious damage or die, ever. Otherwise they wouldn’t be here telling
this story to their grandkits right now. Instead of having harm befall them,
another Raccoon may opt to rescue them, accruing a **Debt** for Raccoon being assisted.



Harming humans, other
animals, and Non-Player Raccoons though? That’s
totally fair game…



**3.4. Debt**

A debt can only be invoked
once and compliance to its demands are non-negotiable. It either is generated
at the start of the game or accrued during play when being rescued from danger.
If the owner of the debt wishes, you must work together as their associate
until the debt is invoked or the owner of the debt no longer requires the assistance.
If this association causes the indebted party to repeatedly endanger
themselves, their family/friends, or their livelihood to a extreme level, then
their debt may be considered absolved even if it was never directly invoked.

Grandkit Info**

** **

**4.1. The Job of the Grandkit**

** **

There is no Game Master in
R&R, instead you play as group of grandkits sitting around the trash-fire
listening to their elders being braggadocios raccoonteurs, re-telling stories
from their chain-breaking youth. It’s up to
you to keep their tales from getting out-of-hand by constantly asking questions
to define, explain, or complicate things for the raccoonteurs. Remember what it’s
like to tell a rowdy group of children a story they don’t already know? Thats
you.



**4.2. Play-Styles**

While they’re
are many ways to run your R&R game, the ideal start for new players is a
Free-Form game where all the players begin in the same Chain Gang.



**4.2.1. Free-form**

In a standard, Free-form
game, the raccoontuers goals are abstract. They will have

personal goal
defined by each player individually at creation and a

group goal defined
by the Grandkit. Succeeding gets you closer to this goal, failing takes you
further away. This is best for one-off games where bookkeeping is more of a
nuisance.

** **

**4.2.2. Variations**

Other variants and optional
rules can be found in section 5.2.



[]()**5.
Grandkit Tips**

** **

**5.1 Play it straight. **

Don’t
have anyone question the fact that Raccoon’s are doing this. All of it is
either considered absolutely normal to any aware bystanders, thought of as “someone
else's problem”, or they have headphones on and refuse to make eye-contact with
anything.



**5.2 Be a fan of the Raccoontuers. **

They are your elders and
your still at that point in your life where everything adults say is gospel.
They are you personal hero’s, so make it seem
that way.

** **

**5.3. Ask questions 24/7 and use the answers. **

Make your players build the
world with their narrative. They are in fact the ones supposed to be telling
the story. Pretend you are rowdy group of children hearing a story for the
first time. ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS. ALL OF THEM. THEN ASK THEM AGAIN. You can
even follow up your questions with more questions.

** **

**5.4. Give everyone a name, a personal goal, and a motivation.**

Anytime the players come
into contact with a NPC, write down their name, their personal goal, and their
motivation for this goal.



**5.5. Make environments expensive and destructible.**

This is Seattle we are
talking about. You can think of some iconic locations such as Pike Place
Market, Seattle Center, the Waterfront, or Bezos’
Balls that you would love to see destroyed in a frenzy of chrome and fur. So
make it happen, place obstacles (and targets) in the path of the raccoonteurs
to avoid (or aim for) while they go on their escapades.

** **

**5.6. Spotlight everybody.**

The raccoonteurs will each
grow into a role eventually, some taking charge, while others tend towards
support. This is expected and encouraged, but it’s
your job to continually rotate the spotlight amongst all the player’s,
especially ones that are quiet and don’t pipe up as much as everybody else so
that everyone has an opportunity to stand out if they want. That being said,
make sure they want it. Some player’s aren’t very comfortable with the
spotlight, so just work with them and try to find a good balance.



**5.7. Sock ****‘em
right in the feels. **

Don’t
be afraid to sacrifice a favorite NPR, location, or item of the raccoonteurs in
order to up the drama. If the players really don’t want it to happen they can
burn Triumph to change the outcome or just ask you not to do it if it actually
bothers them. At the table player agency trumps fun, which in turn, trumps a
good story. Take care of your players and they should take care of you.

** **

** **

** **

[]()**6. Optional Rules & Play
Variants**

** **

**6.2.1. Random Chain Gang Affiliations**

This variation randomizes
Chain Gang affiliation at the start of the game rather than leaving it up to
player decision. This is great if there is an odd number of players and you don’t
want anyone to feel left out when picking teams. #6 also leads to fun
double-crossing drama.



   To determine your affiliation, roll 1D6:

  1. Unaffiliated

  2. Gang 1

  3. Gang 2

  4. Gang 3

  5. Your Choice

  6. Your Choice + Roll Again

** **

**6.2.2. Partners**

This variation is for groups
with an even number of players. You can either let players pick pairs or
randomize the process. For random selection, the GM rolls 1D6; Even=Left &
Odd=Right, 1&2=1, 3&4=2, 5&6=3. The GM, after shifting 1-3 seats in
the direction denoted by the roll, counts aloud around the table up to half the
total number of players twice after. Each player has to remember their number.
The other player with the same number as you is your partner. At this point,
each set of partners may roll on the Random Chain Gang Affiliation chart.



**6.2.3. Alternate Play-Style: Survival**

This variation is intended
for larger groups and long running games. They will have

personal goal
defined by each player individually and a

group goal defined by their
Chain Gang based on the stats at the time. There are 4 statistics relevant to
your Chain Gang:

** **

**Sustenance**

- Food & Water

- To make it through the
winter without any raccoons in your community suffering from malnutrition.

**Resources**

- Bike/car parts, scrap
metal/wood, etc

- To repair anything
ranging from bikes to buildings

**Security**

- Shelter &
Fortification

- To protect from other
Chain Gangs and catastrophes.

**Morale**

- Luxury Items, Achieved
Goals, and Narcotics

- To keep raccoons happy
and functional.

- Sets Mood of Chain Gang
& Tone of Story
